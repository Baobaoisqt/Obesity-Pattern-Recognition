# Welcome to Obesity-Pattern-Recognition Repository

## About

This is a data analytics project focusing on the recognition of dietary habit patterns and prediction of obesity levels, using a dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+).

## Problem Motivation

BMI has been criticised as being an inaccurate tool. One reason is that a person with lots of muscle and minimal body fat can have the same BMI as a person with obesity who has much less muscle. BMI also varies (because average body fat percentage varies) among people of different ages and whether they are active or sedentary. That means it can be misleading in some cases. For instance, an athlete with much more muscle than fat can have a BMI in the overweight range.

## Problem Definition

- How do different dietary habits correlate with obesity levels?
- Can we predict an individual's obesity level based on their dietary habits and routine?

## Models Used

1. K-Means Clustering for Behavioral Pattern Identification
2. Logistic Regression for Obesity Level Prediction

## Conclusion

- Significant dietary patterns influencing obesity were identified.
- A logistic regression model could predict obesity levels with an accuracy of over 65%.
- Consumption of high-caloric foods and frequency of meals/snacks are strongly correlated with obesity levels.
- Surprisingly, a higher frequency of vegetable consumption was associated with higher obesity levels, prompting further investigation.

## What did we learn from this project?

- Advanced data preprocessing techniques and clustering analysis.
- The intricacies of predictive modeling and its evaluation in real-world datasets.
- Insights into dietary patterns and their complex relationships with obesity.
- Enhanced collaboration and version control using GitHub.
- Key performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in the context of imbalanced datasets.
